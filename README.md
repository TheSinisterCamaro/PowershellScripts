# PowerShell Scripts Collection

Welcome to my PowerShell Scripts collection! This repository contains a variety of PowerShell scripts that I have collected and used throughout my career. The scripts in this collection are designed to help with various Windows system administration tasks, including Active Directory management and other Windows-specific functions.

## Current Contents

### Windows-Specific Scripts
- Scripts for managing Windows services, monitoring system health, automating patch management, and more.

### Active Directory Scripts
- A set of scripts aimed at simplifying Active Directory tasks, such as user and group management, session tracking, and security auditing.

## Future Plans

While the current focus is on Windows-specific and Active Directory scripts, I plan on expanding this repository over time. Future updates will include:
- **Cross-platform scripts**: PowerShell scripts that work on both Windows and non-Windows platforms.
- **Security automation**: Scripts for enhancing system security, including compliance checks and incident response automation.
- **Cloud integration**: PowerShell scripts that integrate with cloud services such as Azure and AWS.

## Contributions

If you have suggestions, improvements, or would like to contribute additional scripts, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. I'm always open to collaborating with other IT professionals and enthusiasts.

Thank you for visiting this repository. I hope you find these scripts useful in your own work, and I look forward to continuing to grow this collection over time.
